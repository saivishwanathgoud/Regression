Linear Regression Theory: 

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). 

So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression. 

If we plot the independent variable (x) on the x-axis and dependent variable (y) on the y-axis, linear regression gives us a straight line 
that best fits the data points

The Regression equation => Y= mx + b

Where b is the intercept and m is the slope of the line. So basically, the linear regression algorithm gives us the most optimal value for 
the intercept and the slope (in two dimensions). The y and x variables remain the same, since they are the data features and cannot be 
changed. The values that we can control are the intercept(b) and slope(m). There can be multiple straight lines depending upon the values 
of intercept and slope. Basically what the linear regression algorithm does is it fits multiple lines on the data points and returns the 
line that results in the least error.

The above equation can also be extended to cases where there are more than 2 variables. This is called Multiple Linear Rregression

Regression equation => y = b0 + m1b1 + m2b2 + m3b3 + … … mnbn

Above equation can be used in scenarios, where target variable is dependent upon multiple independent variables.
